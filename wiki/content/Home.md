Welcome to the wiki for the FTL modding information repository! Here you can find various guides and templates to learn how to mod FTL, Hyperspace and Multiverse.

If you're completely new to FTL modding, there are a couple different places you could start depending on what you want to do. If you want to add a new player ship, start with the [Ship Creation Guide](Ship-Creation-Guide). For anything else, start with the [XML Guide](XML-Guide).
