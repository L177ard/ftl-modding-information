Every miniship in Multiverse has icons, which are placed inside `Icon_Box.png`. Most of the icons provided are 20 pixels tall. When placing them in the icon box, there will be a 1 pixel offset between the icon and the top and bottom margins. If the icon is larger, it should be still be centered vertically in the box.

#### The order of icons from left to right is:
- Auto Ship (if the ship is an auto ship)
- Crew
- Present Systems
- Augments
- Missing Systems

The horizontal spacing between icons is 2 pixels. For icons with glows (phantom, STORE_BEACON, etc.), the distance is measured from the outmost opaque pixel.
